TODO:

The Wordef model needs to be changed to remove part from definitions and into main shit
** Test /define route!!!

----Feb 13 cleared databases!!!
//feb 25 - define seems to be working fine but need to only allow lowercase shit in db
	- started to implement register.js from wordsapp
		- its missing a functional handlesubmit

feb 26 - /register route seems to be working but needs tokenization
	- TODO: skip register token functuinality for now ***
	- fixed client side to push to /main after registered
	*** PROBLEM: client side has authenticated true afer successful registration
		- but then how to validate again at sign in?
			- solution is don't log in automatically after register
	- auth in client side needs to be changed
		- have context keep track of userId, not user

feb 27 - app.post("/addWordToCart", async (req, res) => 
		- This route needs to be tested!! Be sure to include word in req body 


when returning user, also populate definitions array to return word definitions.


this needs to be implemented more widely in client side as well as ss
const token = window.sessionStorage.getItem("token");
    const url = "http://localhost:3001/login"; //TODO: change when deploying
    const getUsrUrl = "http://localhost:3001/profile/"; //TODO: change when deploying

    if (token) {
      console.log(token)
      // fetch(url, {
      //   method: "post",
      //   headers: {
      //     "Content-Type": "application/json",
      //     "Authorization": token
      //   }
      // })
      axios({
        url,
        method: "post",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
          "Authorization": token
        }

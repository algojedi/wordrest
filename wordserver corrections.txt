****** pgm crashes when trying to get a nonsensical word??? *****



The Wordef model needs to be changed to remove part from definitions and into main shit
** Test /define route!!!

----Feb 13 cleared databases!!!
//feb 25 - define seems to be working fine but need to only allow lowercase shit in db
	- started to implement register.js from wordsapp
		- its missing a functional handlesubmit

feb 26 - /register route seems to be working but needs tokenization
	- TODO: skip register token functuinality for now ***
	- fixed client side to push to /main after registered
	*** PROBLEM: client side has authenticated true afer successful registration
		- but then how to validate again at sign in?
			- solution is don't log in automatically after register
	- auth in client side needs to be changed
		- have context keep track of userId, not user

feb 27 - app.post("/addWordToCart", async (req, res) => 
		- This route needs to be tested!! Be sure to include word in req body 
 feb 28 
	- need to fix client side
		...const handleAddToCart = async () => {

mar 6 - removing word from cart in reducer gives error
   
mar 7 - //TODO: label for material ui input error label -- main js


when returning user, also populate definitions array to return word definitions.


this needs to be implemented more widely in client side as well as ss
const token = window.sessionStorage.getItem("token");
    const url = "http://localhost:3001/login"; //TODO: change when deploying
    const getUsrUrl = "http://localhost:3001/profile/"; //TODO: change when deploying

    if (token) {
      console.log(token)
      // fetch(url, {
      //   method: "post",
      //   headers: {
      //     "Content-Type": "application/json",
      //     "Authorization": token
      //   }
      // })
      axios({
        url,
        method: "post",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
          "Authorization": token
        }
      })


mar 17 - fixed delete btn
	- TODO: fixed nav bar and general header area

mar 26 - changed renewCart function to hopefully fix initial login issue where cart was not updating
	- kinda fixed main search bar

need to add error messages!

TODO:

The Wordef model needs to be changed to remove part from definitions and into main shit
** Test /define route!!!

----Feb 13 cleared databases!!!
//feb 25 - define seems to be working fine but need to only allow lowercase shit in db
	- started to implement register.js from wordsapp
		- its missing a functional handlesubmit

feb 26 - /register route seems to be working but needs tokenization
	- TODO: skip register token functuinality for now ***
	- fixed client side to push to /main after registered
	*** PROBLEM: client side has authenticated true afer successful registration
		- but then how to validate again at sign in?
			- solution is don't log in automatically after register

when returning user, also populate definitions array to return word definitions.
